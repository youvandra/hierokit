# Introduction

HieroKit is a developer experience (DX) toolkit for building on the Hiero/Hedera network. It sits on top of the official `hiero-sdk-js` / `@hashgraph/sdk` and Mirror Node APIs.

## Why HieroKit?

- **Simplified Interactions**: Complex flows (like multi-sig, smart contract interactions) are streamlined.
- **Best Practices**: Transaction lifecycle handling, retries, and status tracking are built-in.
- **Ergonomic**: Designed to feel natural for modern TypeScript developers.

## Mental Model

If `hiero-sdk-js` shows **HOW** to build and execute a transaction, HieroKit shows **HOW TO USE** a transaction safely and consistently in real applications.
